# Hi there, I'm Guillem Barea 👋
### Computational Physicist | Data Scientist | HPC Specialist

I am a PhD Researcher transitioning into Industry. I specialize in analyzing **high-dimensional, chaotic time-series data** (Fluid Dynamics) and translating complex physical systems into actionable predictive models.

- 🔭 **Currently working on:** Forecasting chaotic turbulence using **LSTM Neural Networks**.
- 🎓 **PhD Focus:** Wall-bounded Supercritical Fluid Turbulence & Modal Analysis (POD/SPOD) at UPC.
- ⚡ **Superpower:** processing **Terabyte-scale** datasets (HDF5) efficiently using High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters.
- 👯 **Looking to collaborate on:** Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PINNs) & Time-Series Forecasting.

### 📊 The "Why" (My Philosophy)
I believe the hardest problems in industry—whether in Tech, Finance, or Engineering—are **multivariate, stochastic, and noisy**. 
My background isn't just "coding"; it's **rigorous mathematical modeling**. I don't just import libraries; I understand the linear algebra and statistics that power them.
