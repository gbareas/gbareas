- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gbareas
- ðŸ‘€ I am currently working in my PhD thesis, focusing in reduced-order models.
- ðŸŒ± Passionate to understand all the intrinsics of low-order models, curious to understand complex data structures using data science, in a path to sharpening my skills in programming language.
- In this repository, you'll find the post-processing scripts I am using in my thesis to understand the flow physics of high-pressure transcritical microconfined systems.
