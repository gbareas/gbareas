# Hi there, I'm Guillem Barea 👋
### Computational Physicist | Data Scientist | HPC Specialist

I am a PhD Researcher transitioning into Industry. I specialize in analyzing **high-dimensional, chaotic time-series data** (Fluid Dynamics) and translating complex physical systems into actionable predictive models.

- 🔭 **Currently working on:** Forecasting chaotic turbulence using **LSTM Neural Networks**.
- 🎓 **PhD Focus:** Wall-bounded Supercritical Fluid Turbulence & Modal Analysis (POD/SPOD) at UPC.
- ⚡ **Superpower:** processing **Terabyte-scale** datasets (HDF5) efficiently using High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters.
- 👯 **Looking to collaborate on:** Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PINNs) & Time-Series Forecasting.

#### 2. [High-Fidelity Spectral Analysis Suite](LINK_TO_MAIN_PHD_REPO_IF_EXISTS_OR_REMOVE)
*The core computational engine behind my PhD thesis, designed to process TB-scale DNS datasets.*

This pipeline is divided into two specialized modules for spatial and spectral feature extraction:

* **[Module A: Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)](https://github.com/gbareas/RHEA_to_POD)**
    * *The Data Science:* **Unsupervised Learning / PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**.
    * **Function:** Performs Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on massive snapshot matrices to extract dominant spatial features.
    * **Method:** Implemented parallelized **POD (PCA)** algorithms to reduce dimensionality and identify energy-containing vortices.

* **[Module B: Spectral POD (SPOD)](https://github.com/gbareas/RHEA_to_SPOD)**
    * *The Data Science:* **Advanced Signal Processing / FFT (Fourier Transforms)**.
    * **Function:** Combines spectral estimation (Welch’s method) with dimensionality reduction to isolate coherent structures in the frequency domain.
    * **Method:** Implemented parallelized **SPOD** algorithms to reduce dimensionality and identify energy-containing vortices.

### 📊 The "Why" (My Philosophy)
I believe the hardest problems in industry—whether in Tech, Finance, or Engineering—are **multivariate, stochastic, and noisy**. 
My background isn't just "coding"; it's **rigorous mathematical modeling**. I don't just import libraries; I understand the linear algebra and statistics that power them.
